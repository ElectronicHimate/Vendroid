Vendroid is a custom Discord client for Android. The way it works is that it loads the Discord mobile website and injects Vencord.

An initial version of Vendroid was made by [Vendicated](https://github.com/Vendicated), [Wing](https://github.com/wingio), and [Xinto](https://github.com/X1nto). However, it is no longer actively maintained. This project has as goal to improve upon the original Vendroid app.

As the Discord website has some annoying bugs, this app isn't 100% stable. I (nin0dev) plan on making patches to enable missing features and improve broken ones.

However, if you currently want to use a mobile mod, you can use [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord), which is based on the pre-React Native version of Discord or [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Pyoncord), that is a Vendetta fork.

## Download

## Build

> Only do this if you made changes to the app's code. If you're looking for prebuilt APKs, check the Download section.

Open the project with Android Studio and open the "Build" drop menu, then hover over "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" and hit "Build APK(s)". Done!
