# Vendroid

> [!WARNING]
> This app is still in beta. Before reporting a bug to Vencord support, please attempt to reproduce the bug on:
> - A mobile browser without Vencord by opening `discord.com/app`
>   - If the issue still happens on mobile browser, it is likely a mobile website issue. You can open an issue here. 
> - A desktop with an official build of Vencord
>   - If the issue still happens on a desktop device with Vencord, it is a Vencord issue and you can report it in the [Vencord](https://discord.gg/vencord) server.
> 
> If the issue happens on neither of these two, the issue is with Vendroid and you can open an issue in this repo. 

Vendroid is a custom Discord client for Android. The way it works is that it loads the Discord mobile and injects Vencord.

An initial version of Vendroid was made by [Vendicated](https://github.com/Vendicated), [Wing](https://github.com/wingio), and [Xinto](https://github.com/X1nto). However, it is no longer actively maintained. This project has as goal to improve upon the original Vendroid app.

As the Discord website has some annoying bugs, this app isn't 100% stable. I (nin0dev) plan on making patches to enable missing features and improve broken ones.

However, if you currently want to use a mobile mod, you can use [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord), which is based on the pre-React Native version of Discord or [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Pyoncord), that is a Vendetta fork.

## Download

> [!WARNING]
> Always check the Actions tab first, as it contains the latest versions of the app. After finishing the setup wizard, Discord may not load. This only happens at that moment, you have to restart the app to load Discord.

## Build

> [!WARNING]
> After finishing the setup wizard, Discord may not load. This only happens at that moment, you have to restart the app to load Discord.

Open the project with Android Studio and open the "Build" drop menu, then hover over "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)" and hit "Build APK(s)". Done!
